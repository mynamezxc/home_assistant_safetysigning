# Holidays

The `holidays` component is a **Home Assistant** integration that creates `calendar` entities with a list of public holidays in a country, based on the Python [Holidays](https://github.com/dr-prodigy/python-holidays) library.
It's primary purpose is to work with [garbage_collection](https://github.com/bruxy70/Garbage-Collection#public-holidays) integration to automatically move entities with `manual_update` automation **blueprints**. But it can also be used independently to show the next public holiday in a given country (or multiple countries).
